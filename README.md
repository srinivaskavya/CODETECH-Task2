### Project: WEB APPLICATION PENETRATION TESTING

### Objective
The objective of web application penetration testing is to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, test security controls, and provide remediation to prevent data breaches. It ensures compliance with security standards, protects sensitive data, and improves overall security, while raising awareness among developers.

### Key activities
-**Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools to detect security flaws.

-**Manual Testing**: Identify deeper vulnerabilities manually.
-**Exploitation**: Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.
-**Authentication & Authorization Testing**: Check secure access controls.
-**Input Validation Testing**: Ensure proper input handling.

### Technologies used
**OWASP ZAP**: Open-source vulnerability scanner.
**Burp Suite**: Comprehensive security testing platform.
**Netsparker and Acunetix**: Automated web vulnerability scanners.
**Nmap**: Network scanning tool.
**SQLmap**: SQL injection exploitation tool.

### Key Insights
**Common Vulnerabilities**: SQLi, XSS, misconfigurations are frequent.
**Input Validation**: Crucial for preventing attacks.
**Authentication & Sessions**: Weaknesses can lead to unauthorized access.
**Security Misconfigurations**: Default settings and exposed debug info are exploitable.
**Regular Testing**: Periodic assessments are necessary due to evolving threats
